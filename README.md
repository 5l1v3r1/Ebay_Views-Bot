## Ebay_Views-Bot

# Description
Simple Program that gives users views on their ebay products. This program is integrated with discord. 

# Current Features
* Allows users to request up to 200 views on a product. 
* See Example Below

# Example
On the discord channel/server you add the bot to:   
  * .view [URL OF PRODUCT] [NUMBER OF VIEWS]
  * .view "https://ebay.com/earphones 100

# TO DO
* Implement Threading to increase speed and efficiency.
* Implement regular expressions to ensure URL is an actual URL
* Make it more user friendly  
  * i.e user only has to call .view and then it will ask user questions like:  
    * What product do you want views for?
    * How many views do you want?
* Increase view limit per request.
* Add Cool-Down 
  * Why: Prevents same user requesting multiple times in a row 
  * Why: Prevents request of views for the same product multiple times in a row
